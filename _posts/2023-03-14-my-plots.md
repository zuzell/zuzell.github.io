title: Similarities of drug and prostitution related crimes in San Francisco.
---

Crime is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that affects individuals and societies in numerous ways. From petty theft to violent crimes, criminal activities are a major concern for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and communities around the world. While each type of crime is unique in its nature and impact, there are often correlations between different types of criminal activities.

Understanding the relationships between different types of crimes is essential for developing effective crime prevention strategies and policies. For instance, studies have shown that individuals who engage in petty theft or property crimes may be more likely to progress to more serious crimes, such as burglary or robbery. Similarly, drug-related crimes and prostitution often go hand-in-hand, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to address these issues. As technology advances, researchers, policymakers, and law enforcement agencies have new tools to study patterns in criminal activities and effectively combat crime.

In this article, we wanted to explore the correlations between drug and narcotic consumption and prostitution, following the conclusion of various papers and books on the topic. The book [“Prostitution and drugs”](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/prostitution-and-drugs) and the papers [“Prostitution, Drug Use, and coping with psychological distress”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002204260003000407) and [“Pathways to prostitution: The chronology of sexual and drug abuse milestones”](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499809551951), inspired us for our exploratory data analysis.

We wanted to highlight the similarities and differences between these two forms of criminal activities. The data provided for our study is the [“Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018”  of the city of San Francisco (USA)](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry). We will examine various aspects of the evidence reflected on the data as a first approach to identify factors that contribute to correlation between these types of crimes.
